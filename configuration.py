    r"""
    A configuration of an induced subtree for a fixed graph.

    This object is used for facilitating the enumeration of all induced
    subtrees of a graph. It offers basic operations, such as forcing the
    inclusion or exclusion of a fixed vertex in the subtree.

    We say that a vertex ``v`` is in the *border* if it is not included, not
    excluded and adjacent to exactly one included vertex.

    ATTRIBUTES:

    - ``graph``: The graph in which the configuration lives.

    - ``subtree_vertices``: The vertices that are in the subtree.

    - ``subtree_size``: The number of vertices in the subtree (included)

    - ``num_leaf``: The number of leaves of the subtree.

    - ``num_excluded``: The number of vertices that are rejected

    - ``border_size``: The number of vertices in the border

    - ``vertex_status``: A dictionary that store the state of each vertex. The
      status of a vertex ``v`` is of one of the following forms:

      * ``(INCLUDED, d)`` if ``v`` is in the subtree and has degree ``d`` in
        the subtree;
      * ``(EXCLUDED, u)``Â if ``v`` is excluded from the subtree, where ``u`` is
        the vertex that caused the exclusion of ``v``. In particular, if ``u ==
        v``, then it means that the vertex was manually excluded by a call to
        the function ``exclude_vertex(v)``.
      * ``(BORDER, None)`` if ``v`` is not in the subtree and is adjacent to
        exactly one vertex of the subtree;
      * ``(NOT_SEEN, None)`` otherwise. This means that ``v`` is not included,
        not excluded and is not adjacent to another included vertex.

    - ``history``: A stack of vertices, in the order according to which they
      have been manually included or manually excluded.

    - ``upper_bound_strategy``: The strategy chosen for computing the leaf
      potential. The leaf potential is an upper bound on the number of leaves
      that any extension of the current configuration could have. Currently,
      the available strategies are either 'naive' or 'dist'.

    - ``lp_dist_dict``: A dictionary indicating all possible leaf potentials
      for the `dist` strategy.

    - ``lp_dist_valid``: A boolean indicating if the structure has changed
      since the last computation of ``lp_dist_dict``.

    - ``border_vertex``: A candidate border vertex.
